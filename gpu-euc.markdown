For Compliance with U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR)

**Effective Date:** 1st December 2025

The U.S. Government regulates the export, reexport, and transfer of
certain advanced semiconductors, computing components, and
associated technologies under the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR). Certain advanced NVIDIA GPUs offered by Exoscale, including
but not limited to B300 and RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell, are classified as
controlled technologies (e.g., ECCN 3A090 or related categories).
Classification is subject to the Commerce Control List and may vary;
final classification determinations are made under 15 CFR Part 774,
Supplement No.1, Category 3.

Providing remote access to such GPUs via cloud services constitutes an
 export under U.S. law, even when no physical product leaves the data center.

## Acknowledgement by Client

By digitally accepting this document the Client
acknowledges and agrees as follows:

### 1. Prohibited Destinations

Client shall not access or allow access to Exoscale GPU instances from, to, or
within any country or territory listed under **Country Group D:1, D:4, or D:5**
of the EAR, or any successor list, as published by the U.S. Bureau of Industry

The current list is available here:

[https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-740/appendix-Supplement%20No.%201%20to%20Part%20740](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-740/appendix-Supplement%20No.%201%20to%20Part%20740)

Client acknowledges that remote access from outside the United States,
or by any foreign national, constitutes an “export” or “reexport”
under EAR, even when no physical item leaves the data center.

Client further acknowledges that exports, reexports, transfers
(in-country), and deemed exports are defined in 15 CFR Sections
734.13–734.15. Client shall not use VPNs, proxies, or other
technical measures to circumvent geo-restrictions, and agrees that
Exoscale may implement geo-blocking/IP controls to enforce these
destination prohibitions.

### 2. Sanctioned Parties

Client shall not permit access to Exoscale GPU instances by any
party:

* Listed on the U.S. Entity List, Denied Persons List, or any other
export/sanctions list administered by the U.S. Government or EU authorities.
* Acting on behalf of, or majority-owned by, any such listed entity.
Client shall conduct reasonable restricted-party screening of users,
contractors, and beneficial owners and maintain auditable records of
such screening.

### 3. Prohibited Uses

Client certifies that Exoscale GPU services will not be used:

* For the design, development, training, or operation of
supercomputers, as regulated by EAR 15 CFR 734.9(h) in any restricted
country.
* For military end-use or by military end-users, including armed forces,
intelligence agencies, national security services, or police, without
securing all necessary licenses.
* For any activities related to weapons of mass destruction, including
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, or missile technology.

### 4. No Transfer Without Authorization

Client agrees not to transfer access credentials or resale rights for
Exoscale GPU instances to any other party without prior written consent
from Exoscale and compliance with EAR licensing requirements. No
sublicensing, sharing, or indirect provisions of access are permitted
without Exoscale’s written consent, and Client shall not facilitate any
circumvention of these controls.

### 5. Compliance Obligation

Client is responsible for ensuring its own compliance and the
compliance of its users, contractors, and affiliates with these
requirements.

### 6. Right to audit and Suspend Access

Exoscale reserves the right to suspend or terminate service access
immediately if it has reason to believe that Client or its affiliates
are in violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions laws.

Exoscale may require additional certifications, conduct reasonable audits
of compliance evidence, and suspend and deny service where a license
appears required or where Exoscale in good faith, identifies elevated
export/sanctions risk. Client agrees to cooperate with Exoscale’s
compliance inquiries and to furnish the requested information promptly.

### 7. Digital Certification and Record Keeping

### 8. Certification of Location

By accepting, the Client certifies that the company’s headquarters
and its parent entities are **not located** in any country or territory listed
under any **Country Group D:1, D:4, or D:5** of the EAR, or any
successor list, as published by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).

Client further certifies that no ultimate beneficial owner with 50
percent or more aggregate ownership is located in any D:1, D:4, or D:5
country, and agrees to promptly notify Exoscale of any change to
headquarters or ultimate parent location.

### 9. Indemnity

Client will indemnify and hold Exoscale harmless from fines,
penalties, losses, and reasonable costs (including attorney’s fees)
arising out of Client’s breach of the export-control and sanctions
obligations in this End User Certificate or applicable law.

### 10. Miscellaneous

The compliance, audit, suspension, indemnity, and record‑keeping
obligations survive termination or expiration of services. If any provision
is found invalid, the remainder remains enforceable. Exoscale may
update these EUC terms to reflect changes in law or policy and will notify
Client; continued use or re‑acceptance constitutes agreement to the
updated terms.

Important note: EUC provides general compliance obligations and is not
legal advice.

Client should consult export‑controls counsel to confirm applicability
to its specific use cases and jurisdictions. Advanced computing rules are
evolving, and the citations herein reflect the current EAR structure.
