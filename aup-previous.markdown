# Third Party Conduct

You are responsible for violations of this AUP by anyone using your Service with your permission or on an unauthorized basis as a result of your failure to use reasonable security precautions.

You must use reasonable efforts to secure any device or network within your control against being used in breach of the applicable laws against spam and unsolicited email, including where appropriate by the installation of antivirus software, firewall software and operating system and application software patches and updates. Our right to suspend or terminate your Service applies even if a breach is committed unintentionally or without your authorization, including through a Trojan horse or virus.
