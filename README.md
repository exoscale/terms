This repository tracks all versions of the Exoscale Terms and Conditions
and other legally binding documents:

* Terms and Conditions

The goal is for customers and observers to facilitate and track changes
with full transparency.

* Previous version: [terms-previous.markdown](terms-previous.markdown)

An archive folder is also published to track older differences from the files
but using git comparison between commit is the preferred method.
