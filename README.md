This repository tracks all versions of the Exoscale contractual documents such as:

* Terms and Conditions.
* End User Service Agreement
* Acceptable Use Policy

The goal is for customers and observers to facilitate and track changes
with full transparency.

The repository is structured as follow:

* Current version: [terms.markdown](terms.markdown)
* Previous version: [terms-previous.markdown](terms-previous.markdown)

The GIT versioning system makes it easier to track older differences from the files.

The terms and conditions are published under the [exoscale website](https://www.exoscale.com/terms/)
